# Storm-Twitter-Analysis
Designed Apache Storm topology to process Twitter's 4j API into the most frequently tweeted words. Stored the results in Redis, hosted on a Flask server and created visualizations with d3. In localhost separate webpages would display the real-time popular tweets in a basic, stream and word cloud format.

Here are some images of the design process and the final product.
